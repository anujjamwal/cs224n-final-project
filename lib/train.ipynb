      "Solve the following math problem. Make sure to put the answer (and only answer) inside \\boxed{}.<|im_end|><|im_start|>userThe radius of the base of a cylinder is increasing at a rate of 0.5 cm/sec while its height is decreasing at a rate of 1.4 cm/sec. At what rate is the volume of the cylinder changing when the radius is 50 cm and the height is 80 cm?<|im_end|><|im_start|>assistant<think>\n",
      "[THOUGHT] Okay, let's see. I need to find the rate at which the volume of a cylinder is changing when the radius is 50 cm and the height is 80 cm. The problem says the radius is increasing at 0.5 cm per second and the height is decreasing at 1.4 cm per second. Hmm, so related rates problem. I remember that for these kinds of problems, you need to relate the rates of change using derivatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "[THOUGHT] First, let me recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume V is πr²h, right? Where r is the radius and h is the height. Since both r and h are changing with time, I need to find dV/dt, the rate of change of the volume with respect to time.\n",
      "\n",
      "To find dV/dt, I should take the derivative of the volume formula with respect to time t. Using the product rule because both r and h are functions of time. Let me write that out. So, derivative of V with respect to t is derivative of πr²h with respect to t. Since π is a constant, it stays outside the derivative. So, π times the derivative of r²h.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the derivative of r²h. Since both r and h are functions of t, I need to use the product rule here. The product rule states that the derivative of two functions multiplied together is the derivative of the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second. So, in this case, the first function is r², and the second is h.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, derivative of r² is 2r dr/dt (using the chain rule), and then multiplied by h, plus r² times the derivative of h, which is dh/dt. Putting that all together, [SOLUTION] dV/dt = π [2r dr/dt * h + r² dh/dt]. [RETURN]\n",
      "\n",
      "[THOUGHT] Now I need to plug in the given values. The radius r is 50 cm, the height h is 80 cm, dr/dt is 0.5 cm/s (since the radius is increasing), and dh/dt is -1.4 cm/s (negative because the height is decreasing).\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me compute each term step by step. [THOUGHT] First term: 2r dr/dt * h. Let's substitute the values. 2 * 50 cm * 0.5 cm/s * 80 cm. Let's compute that. 2*50 is 100, times 0.5 is 50, times 80 is 4000. [SOLUTION] So the first term is 4000 cm³/s. [RETURN]\n",
      "\n",
      "[THOUGHT] Second term: r² dh/dt. So that's (50 cm)² * (-1.4 cm/s). 50 squared is 2500, [SOLUTION] so 2500 * (-1.4) is -3500 cm³/s. [RETURN]\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding those two terms together: 4000 + (-3500) = 500. Then multiply by π. So dV/dt = π * 500 cm³/s. [SOLUTION] Which is 500π cm³/s. [RETURN]\n",

      "[THOUGHT] The volume is increasing at a rate of \\boxed{500\\pi} cm³/s. [RETURN]\n",
      "\n",
      "[THOUGHT] Verified the calculations and signs. [RETURN]\n",
      "\n",
      "[THOUGHT] Wait, let me check the signs again. The radius is increasing, so dr/dt is positive 0.5. The height is decreasing, so dh/dt is negative 1.4. Plugging into the formula:\n",
      "\n",
      "First term: 2*50*0.5*80 = 2*50=100, 100*0.5=50, 50*80=4000. [SOLUTION] 4000. [RETURN]\n",
      "\n",
      "[THOUGHT] 2. The term 2r dr/dt h: 2*50*0.5*80. Let's compute that. 2*50 is 100, times 0.5 is 50, times 80 is 4000. [SOLUTION] 4000. [RETURN]\n",
